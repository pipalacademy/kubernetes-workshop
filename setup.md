# Lab Setup for Docker & Kubernetes Workshop

A virtual machine is already provisioned for each of the participants.

The details of how to access that will be shared at the beginning of the workshop.

If you are curious about how it is setup, look at the packer and terraform configuration in [cloud-setup][] directory in this repo.
